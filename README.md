  Realms Shattered is a CLI (command line interface) text RPG programmed in C++. This game is about learning a new existence where realms and even existence itself has been shattered, and the people divided.

 Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/WraitheDX/realms_shattered/blob/master/docs/contributing.md) for details, and check the [Issues](https://github.com/WraitheDX/realms_shattered/issues) page for what we are currently working on.

## External libraries

  We aim for there to be no external libraries used. We will need platform-specific libs for manipulation of the console/terminal, but ideally we will not be using boost, json or any others (nothing against them, of course).

  I (WraitheDX) feel strongly about this as everyone has their own personal preferences when it comes to libraries, not all are cross-platform, etc. I feel it would better level the playing field if we do as much as possible from the ground up. Each library added is also just another item to consider for someone new coming into the project.
